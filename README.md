# Analyzing Germany House Prices Data and Creating Visualizations using Jupyter Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook project explores the house prices data in Germany and creates visualizations of the variables such as location, size, number of rooms, and age of the property. The goal is to provide insights into the housing market in Germany and identify potential factors that influence house prices.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is obtained from ImmoScout24, a website that provides real estate listings and sales data for properties in Germany. The dataset contains information about residential properties sold, including their location, size, number of rooms, age, and price.

## Technologies Used

Jupyter Notebook

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

## Files
immobilien.csv: contains the raw data used in the analysis
immo_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing Python code used to explore the data and create visualizations

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into the housing market in Germany by analyzing house prices data and creating visualizations of the variables such as location, size, number of rooms, and age of the property. By exploring the correlations between these variables and house prices, we can gain insights into the housing market dynamics and identify potential factors that influence house prices. The project demonstrates the use of Jupyter Notebook, Python, and data visualization tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze and explore large datasets.
